In this example we will show how to launch Elyra using [Kubeflow's Notebook Server](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/notebooks/). 


</PageDescription>


## Requirements
- A Kubeflow Cluster
    - A standard installation of Kubeflow will include the Notebook Server as part of the application stack
    - [Installation Documentation](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/getting-started/)

- Select the desired Elyra container image version from the `elyra/kf-notebook` repositories on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/elyra/kf-notebook) or [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/elyra/kf-notebook). Do NOT use other images, such as the ones in `elyra/elyra`.
  
  OR

  Create a custom Elyra container image following the [instructions in this directory](https://github.com/elyra-ai/elyra/tree/3.0.1/etc/docker/kubeflow). 
    
## Launching Elyra in the Kubeflow Notebook Server
1. In the default Kubeflow welcome page, in the left side menu, click on `Notebook Servers`   
  
   ![Elyra](../images/ai/ai/elyra-with-kf-notebook-splash-screen.png)  
  
1. Click on `NEW SERVER`   
  
   ![Elyra](../images/ai/elyra-with-kf-notebook-notebook-server.png)  
  
1. Choose a `name` for your notebook server, and under `Image` check the box labeled `Custom Image`.   
  
   ![Elyra](../images/ai/elyra-with-kf-notebook-config-1.png)  

1. In _Kubeflow version 1.3 (and later)_ choose `jupyterlab` as image type.

1. As `Custom Image` enter `elyra/kf-notebook:<ELYRA_VERSION>`, replacing `<ELYRA_VERSION>` with the desired image tag, e.g. `2.1.0`.   
  
   ![Elyra](../images/ai/elyra-with-kf-notebook-image-config.png)

   > To pull an image from quay.io prefix the image name with `quay.io`, e.g. `quay.io/kf-notebook:2.1.0`.  
  
1. Customize the resources as required. We recommend at least 1 CPU and 1Gi of memory.
     
1. Your notebook server with Elyra should begin the provisioning process now. When complete, you'll notice a green light and arrow to the left of your notebook. Click on `Connect` to launch Elyra.
