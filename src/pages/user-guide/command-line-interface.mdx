<PageDescription>

The Elyra command line interface (CLI) allows you to manage metadata and work with pipelines.

The CLI is part of the Elyra installation and can be used without a running JupyterLab instance.

## Managing metadata

In Elyra, information such as a [runtime configuration](runtime-conf.md) or a [runtime image](runtime-image-conf) is considered metadata. `elyra-metadata` is used to list, create, update, or delete metadata.

#### Getting help

To display the list of commands that `elyra-metadata` supports, run

```
$ elyra-metadata -h
```

To learn more about a specific command, e.g. `list`, run
```
$ elyra-metadata list -h
```

#### Formatting list output

By default the `list` command displays the results in a user-friendly format. 

```
$ elyra-metadata list runtime-images
Available metadata instances for runtime-images (includes invalid):

Schema          Instance    Resource
------          --------    --------
runtime-image   anaconda    .../runtime-images/anaconda.json
```

Specify the `--json` parameter to return the results in JSON to allow for programmatic processing, e.g. using [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/). 

```
$ elyra-metadata list runtime-images --json | jq ".[].display_name"
"Tensorflow 1.15.2"
"Tensorflow 1.15.2 with GPU"
"R Script"
"Anaconda (2020.07) with Python 3.x"
"Tensorflow 2.3.0"
"Pandas 1.1.1"
"Pytorch 1.4 with CUDA-devel"
"Tensorflow 2.3.0 with GPU"
"Pytorch 1.4 with CUDA-runtime"
"Pandas on quay.io"

```

#### List, create, update, and delete metadata

Refer to the topics below for detailed information on how to use `elyra-metadata` to
 - [Manage code snippets](code-snippets.html#managing-code-snippets-using-the-elyra-cli)
 - [Manage runtime configurations](runtime-conf.html#managing-runtime-configurations-using-the-elyra-cli)
 - [Manage runtime images](runtime-image-conf.html#managing-runtime-images-with-the-command-line-interface)

## Working with pipelines

In Elyra, [a pipeline](https://elyra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/pipelines.html) is a representation of a workflow that you run locally or remotely on Kubeflow Pipelines or Apache Airflow.

#### Getting help

To display the list of commands that `elyra-pipeline` supports, run

```
$ elyra-pipeline --help
```

To learn more about a specific command, e.g. `run`, run
```
$ elyra-pipeline run --help
```

#### Running pipelines

 - [Submit a pipeline for remote execution](pipelines.html#running-a-pipeline-using-the-command-line)
