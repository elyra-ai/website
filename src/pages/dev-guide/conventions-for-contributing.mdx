## File Naming and File Creation
 Elyra extensions use a separate file for each widget, and keep helper functions and classes in the file with that widget. A file containing a widget is named after the widget (i.e. `PipelineEditorWidget.tsx` contains the class `PipelineEditorWidget`).

Files containing util functions are named generically after the utils functionality (i.e. if a util function returned a custom dialog, the file that contained that function would be called `dialog.tsx`).

The index file contains only the definition of the extension class and any other exports that the extension creates.
## Import sections
Elyra extensions create separate sections for imports from different categories (i.e. all imports from `@jupyterlab` would be in a separate section from imports from `@lumino`). Sections are separated by a blank line. Each section is alphabetized by the name of packages.
