## Tutorials

The following tutorials highlight key features of Elyra.

### Run generic pipelines in JupyterLab

Learn how to [create a generic pipeline and run it in your local JupyterLab environment](https://github.com/elyra-ai/examples/tree/master/pipelines/introduction-to-generic-pipelines).

### Run generic pipelines on Kubeflow Pipelines

Learn how to [run generic pipelines on Kubeflow Pipelines](https://github.com/elyra-ai/examples/tree/master/pipelines/run-generic-pipelines-on-kubeflow-pipelines). This tutorial requires a Kubeflow Pipelines deployment in a local environment or on the cloud.

### Run generic pipelines on Apache Airflow

Learn how to [run generic pipelines on Apache Airflow](https://github.com/elyra-ai/examples/tree/master/pipelines/run-generic-pipelines-on-apache-airflow). This tutorial requires an Apache Airflow deployment in a local environment or on the cloud.

## Examples

The https://github.com/elyra-ai/examples repository contains examples you can use to explore Elyra features.

If you have JupyterLab with the Elyra extensions installed, clone the repository using the included [jupyter-git extension](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git):

1. From the main menu select ```git``` > ```Clone a repository.``` (The label texts might vary depending which version of the jupyter-git extension is installed.)
2. Enter ```https://github.com/elyra-ai/examples.git``` as repository URL.
3. In the JupyterLab File Browser navigate to the ```examples``` directory and open ```README.md```.


### Sample pipelines

The following pipelines were created by members of the extended Elyra community and should run as-is in JupyterLab and on Kubeflow Pipelines.
