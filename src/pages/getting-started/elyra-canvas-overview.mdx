## Introduction

The Elyra canvas technology is broken into two main sections: the canvas and the properties. 

The first section, **the canvas**, is used to arrange nodes and connect them. These nodes may be styled as needed and use a toolbar located at the top of the UI which can use any number of configurations to account for the needs of the user. 

The second section, **node properties**, may be edited via a side panel on the right side of the UI. Components that are included in the node properties are located on this site and use the Carbon Design System as its basis.
