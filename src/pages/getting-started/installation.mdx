<PageDescription>

Installation of Elyra canvas will allow for the exploration of the properties of Common canvas and Common properties. However, if you would care to explore more of what the technology can accomplish first with premade examples, take the <a href="https://wdp-common-canvas-dev.stage1.mybluemix.net/#/" target="_blank">Elyra test harness</a> out for a spin (as long as you have an IBM VPN). 

Otherwise, below are your isntructions for getting started with the installation process.

## Introduction
The elyra-ai/canvas repo contains three main components:

#### Common Canvas

This contains canvas functionality which is packaged into the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@elyra/canvas">elyra/canvas NPM module</a> and deployed on the NPM registry. It provides a way for an application to display a flow of data operations (shown as a set of nodes connected with links) defined in a pipeline flow JSON document, to the user and to allows the user to interact with the display to modify the flow. Common canvas is a react component which can be imported, and is assisted by a regular JavaScript class called ```CanvasController``` which provides an API and handles the internal data model of the flow. Common canvas is highly customizable where node shape and appearance, colors, styles layout etc can all be customized by your application code.

#### Common Properties 

This contains properties functionality which is packaged into the elyra/canvas NPM module and deployed on the NPM registry. It provides a way to translate a JSON document, which describes a set of properties with UI hints, into working properties dialog panel. Common properties is a react component and has an associated properties controller object.

#### Test Harness

This provides a node.js app which serves a UI which allows you to try out various features of the common canvas and common properties components. Bear in mind this is not supposed to be a fully functional app but is, as the name suggests, a framework for testing. To get started select a test canvas file from the ```Canvas Diagram``` drop down list and a test palette from the Canvas palette drop down list.



## Installation

You'll need to build your application with common canvas. Common-canvas requires react, react-dom, react-intl, and react-redux libraries to be installed. See peerDependencies in package.json for versions requirements.

Use the command: ```npm install @elyra/canvas --save-dev```

or add this to your package.json file: ```"@elyra/canvas": "x.x.x"```

where x.x.x is the latest build and then run: ```npm install```


## Localization

You must wrapper ```<CommonCanvas>``` and ```<CommonProperties>``` in an ```<IntlProvider>``` object.

If you want to display translated text, the sample code below shows how ```<IntlProvider>``` should be initialized. Your code can set ```this.locale``` to indicate which language should override the default which, in this sample code, is set to english ```en```. The default locale will be used if this.locale is set to a language which is not currently supported.

If you want to provide translations for your own application's text you can import your own bundles and load them into the ```this.messages``` object along with the common canvas and common properties text. If you do this you will have to move ```<IntlProvider/>``` so that it wrappers your React objects as well as ```<CommonCanvas/>``` and/or ```<CommonProperties>```.


```import { IntlProvider } from "react-intl";
import CommandActionsBundles from "@elyra/canvas/locales/command-actions/locales";
import CommonCanvasBundles from "@elyra/canvas/locales/common-canvas/locales";
import CommonPropsBundles from "@elyra/canvas/locales/common-properties/locales";
import PaletteBundles from "@elyra/canvas/locales/palette/locales";
import ToolbarBundles from "@elyra/canvas/locales/toolbar/locales";

class App extends React.Component {

constructor() {
    this.locale = "en";
    this.messages = this._getMessages(
        this.locale,
        [CommandActionsBundles, CommonCanvasBundles, CommonPropsBundles,
         PaletteBundles, ToolbarBundles]
    );
}

_getMessages(locale, bundles) {
  const messages = {};
  for (const bundle of bundles) {
    Object.assign(messages, bundle[locale]);
  }
  return messages;
}

render() {
  <IntlProvider locale={this.locale} defaultLocale="en" messages={this.messages}>
    {Add your <CommonCanvas/> or <CommonProperties/> element here.}
  </IntlProvider>
}

```

## Notes

When building your application you will need to load fonts and override styles can be found <a href="/common-properties/styling#overriding-styles-and-color-themes">here</a>.

## Testing

When testing your application with Jest, this error might show up: crypto.getRandomValues() not supported. See https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid#getrandomvalues-not-supported for details.

To fix, added this to your jest setup file:

```const cryptoJest = require("crypto");
Object.defineProperty(global.self, "crypto", {
	value: {
		getRandomValues: (arr) => cryptoJest.randomBytes(arr.length)
	}
});
```
